Quantum machine learning (QML) is an interdisciplinary field that merges concepts from quantum physics and machine learning. It leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to develop algorithms and techniques for processing and analyzing data. 
Quantum Computing: Quantum computing is a computing paradigm that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to better computing processes and overcome challenges faced by classical computers
Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
Quantum Machine Learning (QML): QML integrates quantum computing concepts with machine learning algorithms to address complex computational problems more efficiently than classical methods
